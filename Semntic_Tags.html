            Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.It is of following types-

        <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Air pollution refers to any physical, chemical or biological change in the air. It is the contamination of air by harmful gases, dust and smoke which affects plants, animals and humans drastically.There is a certain percentage of gases present in the atmosphere. An increase or decrease in the composition of these gases is harmful to survival. This imbalance in the gaseous composition has resulted in an increase in earth’s temperature, which is known as global warming.

        <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Water pollution can be defined as the contamination of water bodies. Water pollution is caused when water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, groundwater and aquifers get contaminated with industrial and agricultural effluents.When water gets polluted, it adversely affects all lifeforms that directly or indirectly depend on this source. The effects of water contamination can be felt for years to come.

        <h2>Land Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Land Pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces. Furthermore, it occurs mainly due to the indirect and direct effects of human activities. Similarly, when we misuse the land resources, land pollution happens.It is a global issue that needs to be fixed immediately. The unnecessary materials contaminate the quality of our land. For instance, even the garbage on the streets is a kind of land pollution only.

        <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
        <p>
            Noise pollution is generally defined as regular exposure to elevated sound levels that may lead to adverse effects in humans or other living organisms. According to the World Health Organization, sound levels less than 70 dB are not damaging to living organisms, regardless of how long or consistent the exposure is. Exposure for more than 8 hours to constant noise beyond 85 dB may be hazardous. If you work for 8 hours daily in close proximity to a busy road or highway, you are very likely exposed to traffic noise pollution around 85dB.
